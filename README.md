# Pathfinder
A group project done with several people. The main aim of the website was to implement dynamic and user-friendly web interface for
the users, using jquery, ajax and php. The website was targetted at high school leavers who would use it to see a future projection 
of what they can achieve based on their grades that they have at the present time. The data retrieval is done through OrientDB,
which is a NoSQl database.
